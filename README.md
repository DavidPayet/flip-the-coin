## Overview

![screenshot](/resources/screenshot.png)

This project is a simple coin flip simulator created as part of the [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io) challenge. The application allows users to flip a coin by clicking on the coin or a button, and it displays the result ("Heads" or "Tails") along with a spinning animation.

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned:
- How to use **CSS animations** to create a flipping effect for the coin.
- How to dynamically update the DOM using **JavaScript** to display the result of the coin flip.
- How to use **event listeners** to handle user interactions (clicks on the coin or button).
- The importance of structuring HTML and CSS for responsive and visually appealing designs.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

## Features

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.

- Users can flip a coin by clicking on the coin or the "RANDOM" button.
- A spinning animation is displayed before showing the result.
- The result ("Heads" or "Tails") is displayed dynamically.
